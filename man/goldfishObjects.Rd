\title{A report of goldfish objects in an environment}
\usage{
goldfishObjects(envir = .GlobalEnv)
}
\arguments{
\item{envir}{an \code{R} \linkS4class{environment} where the goldfish objects are
searched. The default value is \link{.GlobalEnv}.}
}
\value{
Not value, called for printing side effect.

Print detail information of the goldfish object in the environment where the
function is call.
For \code{nodes.goldfish} objects prints the total number of nodes, the attributes
and the linked events to the attributes in the object.
For \code{network.goldfish} objects prints the dimensions of the network, the
nodes sets and events linked to them.
For \code{dependent.goldfish} objects prints the number of events and the default
network linked to them.
}
\description{
Return details about any goldfish objects in a given environment.
