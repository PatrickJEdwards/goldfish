\title{Defining a node set with (dynamic) node attributes.}
\usage{
make_nodes(nodes)

make_nodes_goldfish(nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{a \code{data.frame} object with the nodes attributes with the
following reserved names
\describe{
\item{label}{\code{character} variable containing the nodes labels
(mandatory)}
\item{present}{\code{logical} variable indicating if the respective node
is present at the first time-point (optional)}
}}
}
\value{
an object with an additional class \code{nodes.goldfish} with attributes:
\item{events}{An empty character vector. \code{\link[=link_events]{link_events()}} is used to
link event data frames.}
\item{dynamic_attributes}{An empty character vector. \code{\link[=link_events]{link_events()}} is used to
link event data frames and their related attribute.}

The object can be modified using methods for data frames.
}
\description{
The \code{make_nodes()} function processes and checks the \code{data.frame} passed to
the \code{nodes} argument.
This is a recommended step before the definition of the network.
}
\details{
Additional variables in the \code{nodes} data frame object are considered as the
initial values of the nodes attributes.
Those variables must be of class \code{numeric}, \code{character}, \code{logical}.

It is important that the initial definition of the node set contain all the
nodes that could be potential senders or receivers of events.
In case that all the nodes are not available at all times, the \code{present}
variable can be used to define compositional changes.
Therefore, the initial node set would contain all the potential senders and
receivers nodes and the variable \code{present} will indicate all the nodes
present at the beginning as senders or receivers.
Using \code{\link[=link_events]{link_events()}} is possible to link events where the composition of
available nodes changes over time, see \code{vignette("teaching2")}.

For the attributes in the nodeset to become dynamic, them
can be linked to a dynamic event-list data frames in the initial state
object by using the \code{\link[=link_events]{link_events()}}.
A new call of \code{link_events()} is required for each attribute that is dynamic.

Objects of class \link[tibble:tbl_df-class]{tibble::tbl_df} from the tibble package frequently use in the
tidyverse ecosystem and objects from the \pkg{data.table} package will produce
errors in later steps for goldfish.
Current implementation of goldfish relies on the subsetting behavior of
data frames objects. The previous mentioned objects classes change this
behavior producing errors.
