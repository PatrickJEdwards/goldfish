\usage{
set_preprocessing_opt(
  start_time = NULL,
  end_time = NULL,
  opportunities_list = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_time}{A numerical value or a date-time character string
(parsable by \code{as.POSIXct}) indicating the starting time when the events
are considered for likelihood computation.
All the events that happen before the \code{start_time} are used to compute
the initial values of the effects statistics in the model.
It's useful to set this parameter when the model has windowed effects or
effects that depends of previous order of events (e.g., \code{trans()} and
\code{cycle()} when \code{history} argument is set to sequential or consecutive,
as they are initialized with empty values.
Default is \code{NULL} (start from the first event).}

\item{end_time}{A numerical value or a date-time character string
(parsable by \code{as.POSIXct}) indicating the end time when the events
are not to be considered for likelihood computation.
The preprocessing stage won't stop at this time and will continue
processing events after this time.
Default is \code{NULL} (end with the last event).}

\item{opportunities_list}{A list object. For choice models,
this list specifies, for each dependent event,
the set of available nodes in the choice set.
The list should have the same length as the number of events in the
dependent events objects created with \code{make_dependent_events()}.
Default is \code{NULL}, so the choice set is the set of all nodes present at the
time of the event.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{preprocessing_opt.goldfish} (a list object), with
where the components values are the default values or the values provided
to the function. The list object has the following components:
\item{start_time}{Value from \code{start_time} argument.}
\item{end_time}{Value from \code{end_time} argument.}
\item{opportunities_list}{Value from \code{opportunities_list} argument.}
}
\description{
Specifies control parameters for the data preprocessing stage,
used by \code{estimate_dynam()}, \code{estimate_rem()} and \code{estimate_dynami()}
(when \code{preprocessingInit} is not a
\code{preprocessed.goldfish} object) and \code{gather_model_data()}.
